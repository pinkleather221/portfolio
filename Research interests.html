                <li>Web Accessibility and Inclusive Design</li></ul>
                    <p>I am deeply committed to creating digital experiences
                         that are accessible to all users, regardless of their 
                         abilities or disabilities. My research delves into the latest
                          techniques and technologies to ensure that websites and web 
                          applications prioritize inclusivity and user-friendly navigation.

                Network Security and Cybersecurity</li></ul>
                   <p>In an era where online threats are constantly evolving,
                        I am passionate about researching robust network security measures.
                         From implementing encryption protocols to studying the latest 
                          frameworks, my goal is to contribute to the development of secure
                           and resilient network infrastructures.

                <li> Emerging Technologies: IoT and Edge Computing</li></ul>
                    <p>The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 
                        edge computing introduces exciting possibilities and challenges.
                         My research interests extend to understanding how these technologies
                          can be harnessed to enhance the efficiency and capabilities of both web 
                          design and network engineering.

            <ul>
                <li> User Experience (UX) in Networked Environments</li></ul>
                    <p>User experience extends beyond the visual aesthetics of a website.
                         I am intrigued by the holistic user experience in networked
                          environments, examining how design choices influence not 
                          only the user interface but also the overall satisfaction
                           and efficiency of network interactions. Through my academic 
                           journey and practical experiences,I aspire to contribute valuable 
                           insights to these research areas, shaping the future of web
                            design and network engineering with a focus on innovation,
                            accessibility, and security.  My commitment is to bridge the
                             gap between these disciplines,creating technology solutions 
                             that are not only advanced but also user-centered and resilient.</p>
